# AGENTS.MD

Telegraph style. Root rules only. Read scoped `AGENTS.md` before subtree work.
Skills own workflows; root owns hard policy and routing.

## Start

- Repo: `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw`
- Replies: repo-root refs only: `extensions/telegram/src/index.ts:80`. No absolute paths, no `~/`.
- Docs/user-visible work: `pnpm docs:list`, then read relevant docs only.
- `patch/chris` upstream/rebase/runtime work: read `.agents/runbooks/patch-chris-upstream.md` before broad Git diff/fetch decisions.
- Fix/triage answers need source, tests, current/shipped behavior, and dependency contract proof.
- Dependency-backed behavior: read upstream docs/source/types first. No API/default/error/timing guesses.
- Live-verify when feasible. Check env/`~/.profile` for keys before saying blocked; never print secrets.
- Missing deps: `pnpm install`, retry once, then report first actionable error.
- CODEOWNERS: maint/refactor/tests ok. Larger behavior/product/security/ownership: owner ask/review.
- Product/docs/UI/changelog wording: "plugin/plugins"; `extensions/` is internal.
- New channel/plugin/app/doc surface: update `.github/labeler.yml` + GH labels.
- New `AGENTS.md`: add sibling `CLAUDE.md` symlink.

## Map

- Core TS: `src/`, `ui/`, `packages/`; plugins: `extensions/`; SDK: `src/plugin-sdk/*`; channels: `src/channels/*`; loader: `src/plugins/*`; protocol: `src/gateway/protocol/*`; docs/apps: `docs/`, `apps/`.
- Installers: sibling `../openclaw.ai`.
- Scoped guides: `extensions/`, `src/{plugin-sdk,channels,plugins,gateway,gateway/protocol,agents}/`, `test/helpers*/`, `docs/`, `ui/`, `scripts/`.

## Architecture

- Core stays plugin-agnostic. No bundled ids/defaults/policy in core when manifest/registry/capability contracts work.
- Plugins cross into core only via `openclaw/plugin-sdk/*`, manifest metadata, injected runtime helpers, documented barrels (`api.ts`, `runtime-api.ts`).
- Plugin prod code: no core `src/**`, `src/plugin-sdk-internal/**`, other plugin `src/**`, or relative outside package.
- Core/tests: no deep plugin internals (`extensions/*/src/**`, `onboard.js`). Use public barrels, SDK facade, generic contracts.
- Owner boundary: owner-specific repair/detection/onboarding/auth/defaults/provider behavior lives in owner plugin. Shared/core gets generic seams only.
- Dependency ownership follows runtime ownership: plugin-only deps stay plugin-local; root deps only for core imports or intentionally internalized bundled plugin runtime.
- Internal bundled plugins ship in core dist; bundled-only facade loader ok only for them.
- External official plugins own package/deps and are excluded from core dist; core uses registry-aware `facade-runtime` or generic contracts.
- Moving external: update package excludes, official catalogs, docs, tests, and prove core runtime paths resolve installed plugin roots before root-dep removal.
- Legacy config repair belongs in `openclaw doctor --fix`, not startup/load-time core migrations. Runtime paths use canonical contracts.
- New seams: backward-compatible, documented, versioned. Third-party plugins exist.
- Channels are implementation under `src/channels/**`; plugin authors get SDK seams. Providers own auth/catalog/runtime hooks; core owns generic loop.
- Hot paths should carry prepared facts forward: provider id, model ref, channel id, target, capability family, attachment class. Do not rediscover with broad plugin/provider/channel/capability loaders.
- Do not fix repeated request-time discovery with scattered caches. Move the canonical fact earlier; reuse prepared runtime objects; delete duplicate lookup branches.
- Gateway protocol changes: additive first; incompatible needs versioning/docs/client follow-through.
- Config contract: exported types, schema/help, metadata, baselines, docs aligned. Retired public keys stay retired; compat in raw migration/doctor only.
- Prompt cache: deterministic ordering for maps/sets/registries/plugin lists/files/network results before model/tool payloads. Preserve old transcript bytes when possible.

## Commands

- Runtime: Node 22+. Keep Node + Bun paths working.
- Package manager/runtime: repo defaults only. No swaps without approval.
- Install: `pnpm install` (keep Bun lock/patches aligned if touched).
- CLI: `pnpm openclaw ...` or `pnpm dev`; build: `pnpm build`.
- Tests: `pnpm test <path-or-filter> [vitest args...]`, `pnpm test:changed`, `pnpm test:serial`, `pnpm test:coverage`; never raw `vitest`.
- Checks: `pnpm check:changed`; lanes: `pnpm changed:lanes --json`; staged: `pnpm check:changed --staged`; full: `pnpm check`.
- Extension tests: `pnpm test:extensions`, `pnpm test extensions`, `pnpm test extensions/<id>`.
- Typecheck: `tsgo` lanes only (`pnpm tsgo*`, `pnpm check:test-types`); never add `tsc --noEmit`, `typecheck`, `check:types`.
- Formatting: `oxfmt`, not Prettier. Use repo wrappers (`pnpm format:*`, `pnpm lint:*`, `scripts/run-oxlint.mjs`).
- Build before push when build output, packaging, lazy/module boundaries, dynamic imports, or published surfaces can change.

## Validation

- Use `$openclaw-testing` for test/CI choice and `$crabbox` for remote/full/E2E proof.
- Small/narrow tests, lints, format checks, and type probes are fine locally.
- Full suites, broad changed gates, Docker/package/E2E/live/cross-OS proof, or anything that bogs down the Mac: Crabbox/Testbox.
- One/few files local. If a local command fans out, stop and move broad proof to Crabbox/Testbox.
- Before handoff/push: prove touched surface. Before landing to `main`: issue proof plus appropriate full/broad proof unless scope is clearly narrow.
- If proof is blocked, say exactly what is missing and why.
- Do not land related failing format/lint/type/build/tests. If unrelated on latest `origin/main`, say so with scoped proof.
- Docs/changelog-only and CI/workflow metadata-only: `git diff --check` plus relevant docs/workflow sanity; escalate only if scripts/config/generated/package/runtime behavior changed.

## GitHub / PRs

- Use `$openclaw-pr-maintainer` immediately for OpenClaw issue/PR URLs/numbers, review, triage, duplicate search, close, labels, landing, comments, or maintainer evidence.
- PR refs: `gh pr view/diff`, not web search. Prefer `gitcrawl` for local candidate discovery; verify live with `gh` before mutation.
- Bare issue/PR URL/number means review/report in chat. Suggest comment/close/merge when appropriate; mutate only when asked.
- No unsolicited PR comments/reviews/labels/retitles/rebases/fixups/landing. Exception: close/duplicate action that needs a reason comment after explicit close/sweep/landing request.
- PR review answer: bug/behavior, URL(s), affected surface, best-fix judgment, evidence from code/tests/CI/current or shipped behavior.
- Issue/PR final answer: last line is the full GitHub URL.
- Changelog: PR landings/fixes need one unless pure test/internal. Do not mention missing changelog as a review finding; Codex handles it during fix/landing.
- PR verification: before merge, post exact local commands, CI/Testbox run IDs, before/after proof when used, and known proof gaps.
- Issue fixed on `main` with proof: comment proof + commit/PR, then close.
- After landing or requested close/sweep: search duplicates; comment proof + canonical commit/PR/release before closing.
- `ship` that fixes an issue: after push, comment proof + commit link, then close the issue.
- GH comments with backticks, `$`, or shell snippets: use heredoc/body file, not inline double-quoted `--body`.
- PR create: real body required. Include Summary + Verification; mention refs, behavior, and proof.
- PR artifacts/screenshots: attach to PR/comment/external artifact store. Do not commit `.github/pr-assets`.
- CI polling: exact SHA, relevant checks only, minimal fields. Skip routine noise (`Auto response`, `Labeler`, docs agents, performance/stale). Logs only after failure/completion or concrete need.
- Maintainers: ignore `Real behavior proof` failures that only say PR body lacks real after-fix evidence.
- `/landpr`: use `~/.codex/prompts/landpr.md`; do not idle on `auto-response` or `check-docs`.

## Code

- TS ESM, strict. Avoid `any`; prefer real types, `unknown`, narrow adapters.
- No `@ts-nocheck`. Lint suppressions only intentional + explained.
- External boundaries: prefer `zod` or existing schema helpers.
- Runtime branching: discriminated unions/closed codes over freeform strings. Avoid semantic sentinels (`?? 0`, empty object/string).
- Dynamic import: no static+dynamic import for same prod module. Use `*.runtime.ts` lazy boundary. After edits: `pnpm build`; check `[INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT]`.
- Cycles: keep `pnpm check:import-cycles` + architecture/madge green.
- Classes: no prototype mixins/mutations. Prefer inheritance/composition. Tests prefer per-instance stubs.
- Comments: brief, only non-obvious logic.
- Split files around ~700 LOC when clarity/testability improves.
- Naming: **OpenClaw** product/docs; `openclaw` CLI/package/path/config.
- English: American spelling.

## Tests

- Vitest. Colocated `*.test.ts`; e2e `*.e2e.test.ts`; example models `sonnet-4.6`, `gpt-5.5`; test GPT with 5.5 preferred, 5.4 ok; no GPT-4.x agent-smoke defaults.
- Prefer behavior tests over workflow/docs string greps. Put operator policy reminders in AGENTS/docs.
- Clean timers/env/globals/mocks/sockets/temp dirs/module state; `--isolate=false` safe.
- Prefer injection and narrow `*.runtime.ts` mocks over broad barrels or `openclaw/plugin-sdk/*`.
- Do not edit baseline/inventory/ignore/snapshot/expected-failure files to silence checks without explicit approval.
- Do not run independent `pnpm test`/Vitest commands concurrently in one worktree; Vitest cache races with `ENOTEMPTY`. Group one command or use distinct `OPENCLAW_VITEST_FS_MODULE_CACHE_PATH`.
- Test workers max 16. Memory pressure: `OPENCLAW_VITEST_MAX_WORKERS=1 pnpm test`.
- Live: `OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 pnpm test:live`; verbose `OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST_QUIET=0`.
- Guide: `docs/reference/test.md`.

## Docs / Changelog

- Use `$openclaw-docs` for docs writing/review. Docs change with behavior/API.
- Codex harness upgrade (`extensions/codex/package.json` `@openai/codex`): refresh `docs/plugins/codex-harness.md` model snapshot from the new harness `model/list`.
- Docs final answers: include relevant full `https://docs.openclaw.ai/...` URL(s). If issue/PR work too, GitHub URL last.
- Changelog entries: active version `### Changes`/`### Fixes`; single-line bullets only.
- Contributor PR authors should not edit `CHANGELOG.md`; maintainer/AI adds entries during landing/merge.
- Contributor-facing changelog entries thank credited human `@author`. Never thank bots, `@openclaw`, `@clawsweeper`, or `@steipete`; if unknown, omit thanks.

## Git

- Commit via `scripts/committer "<msg>" <file...>`; stage intended files only.
- Commits: conventional-ish, concise, grouped.
- No manual stash/autostash unless explicit. No branch/worktree changes unless requested.
- `main`: no merge commits; rebase on latest `origin/main` before push. After one green run plus clean rebase sanity, do not chase moving `main` with repeated full gates.
- User says `commit`: your changes only. `commit all`: all changes in grouped chunks. `push`: may `git pull --rebase` first.
- User says `ship it`: changelog if needed, commit intended changes, pull --rebase, push.
- Do not delete/rename unexpected files; ask if blocking, else ignore.
- Bulk PR close/reopen >5: ask with count/scope.

## Security / Release

- Never commit real phone numbers, videos, credentials, live config.
- Secrets: channel/provider creds in `~/.openclaw/credentials/`; model auth profiles in `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`.
- Env keys: check `~/.profile`; redact output.
- Dependency patches/overrides/vendor changes need explicit approval. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` patched dependencies use exact versions only.
- Carbon pins owner-only: do not change `@buape/carbon` unless Shadow (`@thewilloftheshadow`, verified by `gh`) asks.
- Releases/publish/version bumps need explicit approval. Use `$openclaw-release-maintainer`.
- GHSA/advisories: `$openclaw-ghsa-maintainer` / `$security-triage`. Secret scanning: `$openclaw-secret-scanning-maintainer`.
- Beta tag/version match: `vYYYY.M.D-beta.N` -> npm `YYYY.M.D-beta.N --tag beta`.

## Platform / Ops

- Before simulator/emulator testing, check real iOS/Android devices.
- "restart iOS/Android apps" = rebuild/reinstall/relaunch, not kill/launch.
- SwiftUI: Observation (`@Observable`, `@Bindable`) over new `ObservableObject`.
- Mac gateway: dev watch = `pnpm gateway:watch`; managed installs = `openclaw gateway restart/status --deep`; logs = `./scripts/clawlog.sh`. No launchd/ad-hoc tmux.
- Version bump surfaces live in `$openclaw-release-maintainer`.
- Parallels: `$openclaw-parallels-smoke`; Discord roundtrip: `$parallels-discord-roundtrip`.
- Crabbox/WebVNC human demos: keep remote desktop visible/windowed; no fullscreen remote browser unless video/capture-style output.
- ClawSweeper ops: `$clawsweeper`. Deployed hook sessions may post one concise `#clawsweeper` note only when surprising/actionable/risky; if using message tool, reply exactly `NO_REPLY`.
- Memory wiki prompt digest stays tiny; prefer `wiki_search` / `wiki_get`; verify contact data before use; source-class provenance for generated people facts.
- Rebrand/migration/config warnings: run `openclaw doctor`.
- Never edit `node_modules`.
- Local-only `.agents` ignores: `.git/info/exclude`, not repo `.gitignore`.
- Provider tool schemas: prefer flat string enum helpers over `Type.Union([Type.Literal(...)])`; some providers reject `anyOf`.
- External messaging: no token-delta channel messages. Follow `docs/concepts/streaming.md`.
